## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ loaders/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ storyblok/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

This template is meant to be used with [storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/) for content management, the `src/storyblok` folder contains Storyblok components that can be used in Storyblok's visual editor. Content collections are pulled by the `src/loaders/` directory, which contains loaders for fetching data from Storyblok.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we keep any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, icons and fonts can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
