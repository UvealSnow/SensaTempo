Sensa Tempo is a minimal, fast, and SEO-friendly photography blog template built with [Astro](https://astro.build). It is designed to showcase your photography portfolio with a clean and simple layout, while providing excellent performance and SEO capabilities.

- âœ… SEO-friendly with canonical URLs and OpenGraph data
- âœ… Sitemap support

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ loaders/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ storyblok/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

This template is meant to be used with [storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/) for content management, the `src/storyblok` folder contains Storyblok components that can be used in Storyblok's visual editor. Content collections are pulled by the `src/loaders/` directory, which contains loaders for fetching data from Storyblok.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we keep any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, icons and fonts can be placed in the `public/` directory.

- âœ… Astro support with `prettier-plugin-astro`
- âœ… ESLint integration with `eslint-config-prettier`
- âœ… VS Code integration configured
- âœ… Format on save enabled

**Scripts:**
```bash
# Format all files
pnpm format

# Check if files are formatted
pnpm format:check
```

- Semi-colons: enabled
- Single quotes: enabled
- Trailing commas: ES5 compatible
- Print width: 80 characters
- Tab width: 2 spaces
- End of line: LF (Unix)
- Astro file support enabled

### ESLint Setup

ESLint is configured with TypeScript and Astro support to catch potential issues and enforce coding standards.

**Features:**
- âœ… Modern flat config format
- âœ… TypeScript support with `@typescript-eslint`
- âœ… Astro file support with `eslint-plugin-astro`
- âœ… Prettier compatibility (no formatting conflicts)
- âœ… Browser and Node.js globals configured

pnpm lint:fix
```

**ESLint Rules Enabled:**
- JavaScript/TypeScript recommended rules
- No unused variables (with underscore prefix exception)
- No console warnings, debugger errors

- Astro-specific rules for component best practices

### VS Code Integration

For the best development experience:

1. **Install recommended extensions** (VS Code will prompt you):
   - `astro-build.astro-vscode` - Astro language support
   - `esbenp.prettier-vscode` - Prettier formatter
   - `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint` - ESLint integration
   - `bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss` - Tailwind CSS support

2. **Automatic formatting and linting:**
   - Code formats automatically on save
   - ESLint issues are highlighted in real-time
   - Both tools work together without conflicts

### Configuration Files

- `.prettierrc` - Prettier configuration
- `.prettierignore` - Files to exclude from formatting
- `eslint.config.js` - ESLint flat configuration
- `.vscode/settings.json` - VS Code workspace settings
- `.vscode/extensions.json` - Recommended extensions
